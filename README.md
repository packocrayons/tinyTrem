# tiny trem
## goals
- Continuous rotation pots, for continuously variable frequency. Have a "sensitivity" pot so exact frequencies can be found quickly, then dialed in well
- MIDI input - have a MIDI mode where adjusting changes the trem to quarter, 16th, whatever notes
- waveforms? Something cool with waveforms
- "stable" mode - once in a stable mode, _stop_ reading the pots because they like to drift around, especially in noisy environments
